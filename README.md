# THZs-Tailless-Cursors
[![main image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THZ-GH/THZs-Tailless-Cursors/main/Cursor%20Showcase.png)](#features)
A few Windows cursors I made. Inspired by Posy on YouTube. Some of this work is not mine.


Some code (such as the installer, for example) was modified or mirrored from [https://code.garrettmills.dev/garrettmills/archive-posy-cursors](url).
